### Opprc binary
This directory contains the binary, which can be found in red star os at /usr/bin/opprc
Current analisys shows that unless you have the /dev/res device and run the program as root,
no harm should be done. Despite that, it is not recommended to run the binary outside of vm.

### Decompiling
So far in this project, Cutter was used for decompiling the binary. If you will be using something
else, please specify this in a comment of the decompiled source.
